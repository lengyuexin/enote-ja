off year 这一解释出于《汉英大辞典》，off year是目前使用最普遍的翻译，但是这个翻译却并不贴切，因为off year在英文解释中表示“非大选年”的意思，被中国人转义为“小年”，同时off year在英文中还指果树、竹子的歉收年，所以off year的译法与我们中国小年的祭灶习俗等活动完全是风马牛不相及。 a lunar year in which the last month has 29 days 这一解释出于《上海译文汉英大辞典》，意思指农历腊月是小建的年份，也就是说，农历腊月只有29天，没有年三十的年份。同时《外研社汉英双语现代汉语词典》中也有类似解释。 festival on the 23rd or 24th of the 12th month of the lunar year, when sacrifices are made to the kitchen god 在《汉英词典》中出现的对于小年的解释：意思是节日，腊月二十三或二十四日，旧俗这天祭灶。 对于小年用英语怎么说，有人建议可以用Minor New Year，但New Year显然不是春节的意思，似可考虑Minor Spring Festival或Minor Chinese New Year的说法

根据一个给定的句子结构，可通过其接续方式判断某个动词是否为及物动词，也可根据及物动词和非及物动词的特点反向验证该如何接续。值得注意的是，某些动词既有及物用法又有不及物用法，要根据特定使用场景来判断。 例句:he got to BeiJing . 正向分析: got 后并未直接加名词,说明got在这里是不及物动词,所以例句名词前加上了介词to 反向分析: 正向分析可知got在这里是不及物动词,再造其他类似的句子也不能直接加名词 及物动词和不及物动词 及物动词可直接接续名词 不及物动词需要在名词前加介词，只能造主谓的结构 常见不及物动词(go/listen/think/look/talk/live/get) go home/ go to home 首先，这两种方式都是对的，只是表达的角度不同 go home, go作为不及物动词，home作为副词，是副词修饰动词的结构 go to home, go 依旧是不及物动词，但是home作名词使用，所以接续需要名词前加介词to 句子衍生句子分析 he went abroad went为不及物动词，he went 已经构成完整的主谓结构 句子结构完整情况下，扩充只能加入定语，状语，同位语，其中加入介词短语或副词居多 介词短语由介词+宾语构成，这里abroad显然是副词 衍生例句 I saw him abroad. 地点副词，修饰动词saw，我在国外见过他 He is lost abroad.地点副词，修饰形容词lost，他在国外迷路了 He is abroad. 地点副词，主系表结构，表语可以是名词/形容词/副词/介词短语/动词过去分词 词性判断 通过公式反用可以更清晰的确定词性，灵活运用 1. He lives x x 下边的例句有些代表性，对于xx结构，可以是介词短语也可以是两个副词，需要根据其中文意思判断。去掉一个副词若与原意完全不一致，则作为介词短语使用。 he lives near here. 去掉near，意为他住在这，而不是想表达的住这附近，所以这里near为介词，here为名词 he came here late. 去掉here,意为他来晚了，和原意几乎相近，所以这里here,late是两个副词 2. I don’t know about x 这里动词know后接续为介词about，说明know是不及物动词 I don’t know 已经是完整的主谓结构，这里后续扩充的一定是介词短语。 介词短语构成为介词+宾语,所以这里的x一定是宾语组成成分中的一种。 3. She is angry x x She is angry已经是一个完整的结构，后边xx 要么是两个副词，要么是介词短语。 4. He x on the street on the street是介词短语，主语是He，x只能是动词。 5. I left BeiJing x him I left BeiJing是完整的主谓宾结构，这里扩充的话x只能是介词 6. He is looking x look为不及物动词， He is looking是完整的主谓结构，这里扩充的话x只能是副词","categories":[{"name":"英语基础","slug":"英语基础","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/categories/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"}],"tags":[{"name":"陈述句","slug":"陈述句","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/tags/%E9%99%88%E8%BF%B0%E5%8F%A5/"}]},{"title":"陈述句--长句构成","slug":"statement_10","date":"2020-03-20T10:22:10.790Z","updated":"2020-03-20T07:57:28.381Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/03/20/statement_10/","link":"","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/2020/03/20/statement_10/","excerpt":"","text":"陈述句–长句构成
