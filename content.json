off year 这一解释出于《汉英大辞典》，off year是目前使用最普遍的翻译，但是这个翻译却并不贴切，因为off year在英文解释中表示“非大选年”的意思，被中国人转义为“小年”，同时off year在英文中还指果树、竹子的歉收年，所以off year的译法与我们中国小年的祭灶习俗等活动完全是风马牛不相及。 a lunar year in which the last month has 29 days 这一解释出于《上海译文汉英大辞典》，意思指农历腊月是小建的年份，也就是说，农历腊月只有29天，没有年三十的年份。同时《外研社汉英双语现代汉语词典》中也有类似解释。 festival on the 23rd or 24th of the 12th month of the lunar year, when sacrifices are made to the kitchen god 在《汉英词典》中出现的对于小年的解释：意思是节日，腊月二十三或二十四日，旧俗这天祭灶。 对于小年用英语怎么说，有人建议可以用Minor New Year，但New Year显然不是春节的意思，似可考虑Minor Spring Festival或Minor Chinese New Year的说法

He lives x x 下边的例句有些代表性，对于xx结构，可以是介词短语也可以是两个副词，需要根据其中文意思判断。去掉一个副词若与原意完全不一致，则作为介词短语使用。 he lives near here. 去掉near，意为他住在这，而不是想表达的住这附近，所以这里near为介词，here为名词 he came here late. 去掉here,意为他来晚了，和原意几乎相近，所以这里here,late是两个副词 2. I don’t know about x 这里动词know后接续为介词about，说明know是不及物动词 I don’t know 已经是完整的主谓结构，这里后续扩充的一定是介词短语。 介词短语构成为介词+宾语,所以这里的x一定是宾语组成成分中的一种。 3. He x on the street on the street是介词短语，主语是He，x只能是动词。 4. I left BeiJing x him I left BeiJing是完整的主谓宾结构，这里扩充的话x只能是介词 主谓(宾) 我吃了 I ate. 我去了北京 I went to BeiJing. 他认识他 He knows him. 他要来北京 He is going to come to BeiJing. 我会回来的 I will come back. 他们在看电视 They are watching TV. 他已经吃过了 He has eaten. 主系表 我昨天没在家 I was not at home yesterday. 你会是一个好爸爸的 You will be a good father. 地铁正在被建 The subway is being built. 他已经当了3年的老师了 He has been a teacher for 3 years. 我明天会在北京的 I will be in BeiJing tomorrow. 这件事很快会被解决的 This thing will be solved soon. 他很乐观 He is very optimistic. 我当时很尴尬 I was very embarrassed. 手机在桌子上 The phone is on the desk. 那条河很长 That river is very long. 主谓间宾+直宾 他给了我一次机会 He gave me(间宾) a chance(直宾). 他给我讲了个故事 He told me a story. 他借给了我100块钱 He lent me 100 yuan. 他给我写了一封信 He wrote me a letter . 他给我发了张照片 He sent me a picture . 他给我们带了些吃的 He brought us something to eat. 他给我提供了一份工作 He offered me a job . 他给我读了一篇文章 He read me an article . 他给我看了他的新车 He showed me his new car. 他给我看了他的票 He showed me his ticket. 主谓宾+宾补 宾补用于对宾语的情况进行补充说明，宾+宾补可以构成主系表结构。 他把房间涂成了蓝色 He painted the room blue. 他把所有东西都准备好了 He got everything ready. 我希望你健康 I wish you healthy. 你要把我逼疯了 You are driving me crazy. 我发现英语很困难 I found English difficult. 他发现房子很脏 He found the house dirty. 我发现这本书很有趣 I found the book interesting. 他让我生气 He made me angry. 他让这问题变得更困难了 He made the problem harder. 你使我们成为了一家人 You made us a family. 高频扩充 对生活中常用的词汇词组句型进行扩充 want/need want/need+n 想要/需要 我想要那本书 I want that book. want/need+to do 想要做/需要做 我想去睡觉 I want to go to sleep. want/need+sb+to do 想要某人做/需要某人做 我想让你开心 I want you to be happy. need/have to 此时need含义与have to 相同，可翻译成不得不、得 我得走了 I need to /have to go. 对于不可自主控制的意识，用need 你不用害怕 You don’t need to be afraid. had better(not) do sth 最好(不)做某事 你最好别告诉他这件事 You had better not tell him the thing. 你最好早点起 You had better get up early. have sth to do 有某事要去做 我有个飞机要赶 I have a plane to catch. 我有个会议要出席I have a metting to attend. 我有事要告诉你 I have something to tell you. 祈使句 主语为第二人称，可省略，表示说话者对对方的请求/命令/叮嘱/邀请/劝告/警告等 肯定句 do,否定句，don’t 可加副词,never,always,please等 走开 Go away. 安静点 Be quite. 别打扰我 Don’t disturb/bother me. 远别迟到 Never be late. let 让我们走吧 Let us go. 让门开着 Let the door be open. 让他们过去 Let them through. 别让他坐下 Don’t let him sit down. let us 和 let’s let’s 是let us 的缩写，但表达有差异，let us 侧重单方的请求，let ‘s 侧重双方的建议 let’s 的否定在us后加not ，不可用don’t 别让我们告诉他真相 Don’t let us tell him the truth. 我们别告诉他真相了 Let’s not tell him the truth. 别让我们做作业了 Don’t let us do the homework 让我们别做作业了 Let’s not do the homework. no +n/doing 禁止拍照 No photos./No taking photos. 禁止抽烟 No smoking. 省略 一杯咖啡，谢谢 A cup of coffee,please. 再一分钟 One more minute. 再来一个 Another one. 反义疑问句 别告诉他，行吗 Don’t tell him, will you? 认真点，行吗 Be serious, will you? 我们出去吧，行吗 Let’s go out,shall we? there be +名词 主系表 屋里有多少人 How many people are there in the room? 杯子里有多少水 How much water is there in the cup? 这两者之间有不同吗（difference）Are there any differences between these two? 这次会有不同吗 Are there going to be any differences this time? what…for,类似why 这是干嘛的 What is this for? 你给我打电话干嘛 What did you call me for? 你干嘛笑 What are you smiling for? 你干嘛告诉她 What did you tell her for? how come +陈述句 怎么会出现某种情况 你怎么会在这 How come you are here?/How are you here? 你怎么会知道 How come you knew it? 你怎么会不喜欢他 How come you don’t like him? look,sound,smell,taste,feel+adj/+like +n 你看起来很累 You look very tired. 这主意听起来不错 The idea sounds nice. 这花闻起来很香 The flower smells very sweet. 这道菜尝起来很美味 This dish tastes very delicious 这丝绸摸起来很滑 The silk feels smooth. 他看起来不像好人 He doesn’t look like a good person. 花费 spend 主语是人，花费的时间或金钱/cost/take主语是物，花费人的钱/物 spend time/money+ (in) doing /on sth/with sb it take (sb) time to do sth n +cost sb money /it +cost sb money to do sth 你花了多长时间在你的作业上 How long did you spend on your homework? 你一般都花多长时间做作业 How long do you spend doing your homework? 做作业花了你多久 How long did it take you to do your homework? 这本字典花了你多少钱 How much money did this dictionary cost you? how about/what about 提出建议或请求 出去走走怎么样 How about going out for a walk? 我们去哪啊？北京怎么样 Where will we go?
