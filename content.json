在《汉英词典》中出现的对于小年的解释：意思是节日，腊月二十三或二十四日，旧俗这天祭灶。 对于小年用英语怎么说，有人建议可以用Minor New Year，但New Year显然不是春节的意思，似可考虑Minor Spring Festival或Minor Chinese New Year的说法

根据一个给定的句子结构，可通过其接续方式判断某个动词是否为及物动词，也可根据及物动词和非及物动词的特点反向验证该如何接续。值得注意的是，某些动词既有及物用法又有不及物用法，要根据特定使用场景来判断。 例句:he got to BeiJing . 正向分析: got 后并未直接加名词,说明got在这里是不及物动词,所以例句名词前加上了介词to 反向分析: 正向分析可知got在这里是不及物动词,再造其他类似的句子也不能直接加名词 及物动词和不及物动词 及物动词可直接接续名词 不及物动词需要在名词前加介词，只能造主谓的结构 常见不及物动词(go/listen/think/look/talk/live/get) go home/ go to home 首先，这两种方式都是对的，只是表达的角度不同 go home, go作为不及物动词，home作为副词，是副词修饰动词的结构 go to home, go 依旧是不及物动词，但是home作名词使用，所以接续需要名词前加介词to 句子衍生句子分析 he went abroad went为不及物动词，he went 已经构成完整的主谓结构 句子结构完整情况下，扩充只能加入定语，状语，同位语，其中加入介词短语或副词居多 介词短语由介词+宾语构成，这里abroad显然是副词 衍生例句 I saw him abroad. 地点副词，修饰动词saw，我在国外见过他 He is lost abroad.地点副词，修饰形容词lost，他在国外迷路了 He is abroad. 地点副词，主系表结构，表语可以是名词/形容词/副词/介词短语/动词过去分词 词性判断 通过公式反用可以更清晰的确定词性，灵活运用 1. He lives x x 下边的例句有些代表性，对于xx结构，可以是介词短语也可以是两个副词，需要根据其中文意思判断。去掉一个副词若与原意完全不一致，则作为介词短语使用。 he lives near here. 去掉near，意为他住在这，而不是想表达的住这附近，所以这里near为介词，here为名词 he came here late. 去掉here,意为他来晚了，和原意几乎相近，所以这里here,late是两个副词 2. I don’t know about x 这里动词know后接续为介词about，说明know是不及物动词 I don’t know 已经是完整的主谓结构，这里后续扩充的一定是介词短语。 介词短语构成为介词+宾语,所以这里的x一定是宾语组成成分中的一种。 3. She is angry x x She is angry已经是一个完整的结构，后边xx 要么是两个副词，要么是介词短语。 4. He x on the street on the street是介词短语，主语是He，x只能是动词。 5. I left BeiJing x him I left BeiJing是完整的主谓宾结构，这里扩充的话x只能是介词 6. He is looking x look为不及物动词， He is looking是完整的主谓结构，这里扩充的话x只能是副词","categories":[{"name":"英语基础","slug":"英语基础","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/categories/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"}],"tags":[{"name":"陈述句","slug":"陈述句","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/tags/%E9%99%88%E8%BF%B0%E5%8F%A5/"}]},{"title":"陈述句--长句构成","slug":"statement_10","date":"2020-03-20T10:22:10.790Z","updated":"2020-03-20T07:57:28.381Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/03/20/statement_10/","link":"","permalink":"https://lengyuexin.github.io/enote-ja/2020/03/20/statement_10/","excerpt":"","text":"陈述句–长句构成

从过去开始一直延续到现在的时间段,结构为have/has+done 特点 现在完成时和一般过去时很像，都指的是发生过的事。 现在完成时强调完成，对之后有影响 一般过去时只是简单的叙述。 常常和[已经],[还],[刚刚]等词语连用(already,yet,just) 示例 我吃完饭了 –纯叙述 我已经吃完饭了 – 你们吃吧 我看了一部电影 –纯叙述 我已经看过这部电影了 – 不想看第二遍，能不能换一个？ 我没起床 –纯叙述 我还没起床 –等我起床后再出去玩 时间段 对时间段的提问用how long (since),回答用for或since. 动词要用可延续性谓语动词或系动词 使用when提问的多是时间点,一般过去时 动词划分 动词分为谓语动词和系动词两大类 谓语动词分为可延续性和不可延续性两类 系动词包含be动词和其他系动词(如感官系动词) 不可延续动词的转换 原型
